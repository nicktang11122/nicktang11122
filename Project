Hi there! I'm a Freshman at Northeastern University pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
I am passionate about technology and data; my interests are firmly in software development. I'm looking forward to using my skills and excitement to dive into innovative projects, especially ones that match up with what I'm studying. I'm all about finding experiences that push me to learn more and do better, while also fitting into the bigger picture of my goals for school and beyond. I want to get involved in work that's meaningful to me personally and professionally, helping me grow every step.
